Project: Machine Learning Model for Private Equity Firms to Analyze and Predict Student Loan Outcomes for Investments

Mission: Develop a ML Model that will help predict loan repayment, employment outcomes, and expected salaries for student loan borrowers.

I will analyze:
1.	Student Loan Amounts
2.	Universities Attended
3.	Degree Earned
4.	Jobs

to provide a private equity firm with complete insight to help them invest in Student Loans wisely.

Using all the datasets I want to analyze (mentioned above) my goal is to use Machine Learning to be able to: 
1.	Analyze Employment Outcomes: Use machine learning  to analyze degree types and colleges to see which  job roles and salaries a student is likely to get. 
2.	Predict Loan Repayment Capability:  ML will help identify
       1. High-Risk
       2. Medium-Risk
       3. Low-Risk loans.

These  ML predictions will help to create a comprehensive analysis report of student loans  which will help a private equity firm allocate capital efficiently and minimize investment risk as much as possible.
